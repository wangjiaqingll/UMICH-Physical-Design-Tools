        -net names are now read from and saved to .nets files
           * if a .wts file declares the weight of a net more than once,
             the last value is take and  no error is reported
        -net weights are now read from and saved to .wts files
           * net weights 1.0 (or very close) are not saved
             since 1.0 is assumed by default
           * if a no-name net has a non-trivial weight, 
             it names defaults to "net<numerical_index>";
             no safety checks are made
        -regression tests changed accordingly
        -when saving, check if node names exist; 
         if they don't, use generic "a/p" names as in .net format
