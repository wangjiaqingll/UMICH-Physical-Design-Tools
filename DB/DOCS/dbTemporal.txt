dbTemporal
==========

  Contains the timing information gathered from LEF/DEF files.
  
Overview
--------

The dbTemporal class contains information about the timing
characteristics of the design. This information is contained in two
basic structures:

1) A series of dbTEdgeTimingInfo structures (which contain information
   regarding gate delays between two dbMasterPin's);

2) A timing graph containing nodes for each of the relevant pins. Each
   node contains information relevant to the pin (e.g., on resistance,
   load capacitance) and each edge, to the relevant pair of
   dbMasterPin's.

Construction & Population
-------------------------

The dbTemporal pointer inside DB should be filled by a new object
constructed by the parser. This object should then be populated
according to the following procedure:


1) each time a MACRO TIMING statement is found, the method addInfoTo()
   should be called, passing the appropriate dbMasterPin's as parameters;

2) for each piece of information gathered from the file, the
   corresponding method add*() should be called.
