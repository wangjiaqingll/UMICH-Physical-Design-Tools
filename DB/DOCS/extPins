external pin declared as
INPUT should be an OUTPUT pin to its fake cell, and vice versa, on
the grounds that it's an INPUT to the chip or block, meaning that it
sends a signal *in* to a net, which is what an *out* pin does on
an ordinary cell.  That made sense.

So my parser will resolve INPUT --> OUTPUT, OUTPUT --> INPUT, INOUT --> INOUT.
(FEEDTHROUGH  should be FEEDTHROUGH (?))
