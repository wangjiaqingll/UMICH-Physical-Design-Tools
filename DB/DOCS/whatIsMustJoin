if a cell has, say, 6 pins A, B, C, D, E, F
then LEF can do something like:

pin A

pin B mustjoin pin A

pin C

pin D mustjoin pin A

pin E

pin F mustjoin pin C


So, here there are two "sets" -- this is why Igor and I thought that
we need a vector of vectors.    In this example, one vector would be
A/B/D, the other would be C/F, and each of the pins A,B,C,D,F would
have a pointer to the appropriate vector (pin E would have a null pointer).
