----------------------

  AUX files are to be used to support multifile formats (e.g. LEFDEF)
  by storing references to several files together with format names.

  1. Support for comments.
     Lines starting with hash symbol (#) are ignored (considered comments).
        It is recommended that every AUX file is annotated at least  with
        creation date, author's email and, if produced by a program,
        command line (in this case  author's email can be substituted
        by the userId under which the program ran). Other information
        (e.g. benchmark sizes) can be put into comments in aux files.


  2. Each non-commented line of AUX file should start either with a 
     one-word format name or a one-word command. The second word
     must be colon (:). 

  3. Known format names include LEFDEF and LEFDEFLGC.
     Users can freely introduce new format names provided they
     do not clash with existing format names and commands.

  4. A list of all filenames for a given multifile foormat should
     follow the colon on the same line. No extra filenames allowed.
     Relative file names are considered from the directory of the
     aux file, unless one or more CD commands (see 5.) were interpretted
     before the format line.

  5. Currently, the only supported command is CD. It takes one argument
     which goes after the colon. All further filenames will be interpretted
     as being within the directory set by CD command which understands
     both relative and absolute directory names.

  6. (partially implemented) All of the above must work on Unix systems and
     on Windows systems (having different path delimiters conventions).

     Aux files not using absolute path names should work both on
     Unix and Windows systems w/o change in most cases (i.e. aux readers
     should convert path delimiters according to the host system type)
