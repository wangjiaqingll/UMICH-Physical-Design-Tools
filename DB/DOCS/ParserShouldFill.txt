 
    What information is filled by parser, what by postProcessor

  dbContext
      populated by postProcessor only
      (at least this is our epxectation)
  dbNetlist
      populated partially by the parser(s), 
      some work is done by postProcessor
      (e.g. cells on nets, nets on cells)

      Filled by parser
	dbNetlist
	dbCell
	dbMasterCell
	dbPin
	dbMasterPin
	dbNet
     anything not here is currently being filled in by the postProcessor.

  dbSpatial
      populated by parser(s) only

  dbTiming
      populated by parser(s) only

  dbEasyAccess
      populated by the postProcessor only

=======================================================================
        The parsers don't have to sort anything...not pins on a cell
        or net..not cells in dbNetlist..not anything.  You are of course
        welcome to if you'd like, but postProcessor will always sort everything
        (of course, if it's sorted, it will finish immediately)
        For _index values in cells and nets (and everywhere else)..the only
        req is that each one be unique..it's the tie-breaker in many of
        the sorting algorithms.  It doesn't matter what order you number
        them in, just that each, say, cell has a unique _index.

FYI: Macro pin LEQ is not in nsiDesign, so I cannot set dbNetlist::_pinLEQs
