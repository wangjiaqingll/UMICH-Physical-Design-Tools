  The text of this advisory is to be used for information purposes only.

  Developers and/or maintainers will attempt to provide installation 
  instructions, describe the general purpose of released source codes
  and executables as well as provide relevant references (e.g., to 
  technical reports and conference papers). However, providing 
  comprehensive documentation may be impossible due to resource/funding
  limitations.

  Realizing this, developers will provide limited and selective support
  for the released source code and executables by electronic or regular mail.
  This advisory encourages all users to request additional documentaion, 
  instruictions and clarifications. Developers will attempt to answer such
  requests as time allows, establish mailing lists for users and maintain
  answers for Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ). Users are encouraged to read
  such lists and other available documentation prior to requesting support.

  Appendix: 
            The home page for this distribution is 
            http://nexus6.cs.ucla.edu/software/PDtools/ .
            In particular, it lists various papers describing algorithms
            implemented (more papers are available at
                         http://vlsicad.cs.ucla.edu/pubs.html).
            A software/interest group on fundamental VLSI CAD
            implementations is maintained at
            http://gigascale.org/bookshelf
            (see "request membership" link at the bottom)
            Members of this group are subscribe to a genral-interest
            mailing list, and there is a mailing list for developers.
            A listing of available "bookshelf slots" is available at
            http://vlsicad.cs.ucla.edu/software/GSRC/bookshelf/Slots/

            Several slots have dedicated user groups and mailing lists
            http://www.gigascale.org/ucladb
            http://www.gigascale.org/bk_placement
            http://www.gigascale.org/bk_partitioning

            Some of these groups have FAQs and discussion fora.

            Membership in some groups at the gigascale.org site is restricted
            to funding companies and member research insitutions.
