1.0  	aec	
	first released version 

1.1 	aec
	renamed classes/files to not conflict with Clustering

1.2  	aec 980917
	major revision. removed slice, parent/child relationships, and
	many other un-necessary things.  Removed Hierarchical base class.

1.2.1 	aec 980918
	change to ClHG_Cluster 'interior' node ctor..removed sorting of
	CutNets

1.3	aec 980919
	code to remove duplicate edges, and weight the remaining ones.
	Added a param, removeDup, to remove either 0(none), 2(only deg2),
	or 3(deg2 and deg3 edges).

1.3.1   aec 980921
	change to the cluster area limits.  params are now:
	maxNewClRatio, maxChildClRatio, and maxClArea

1.3.2   aec 980922
	added support for Vcycling

1.5     aec 981002
	updated to new HGraph w/ faster construction of the level HGraphs.
	allowed clustering w/ terminals if a partitioning was passed
	 to ClusteredHGraph ctor
	removed interior node ctor.  When to nodes are clustered,
	 the higher numbered on is merged into the lower numberd one.

1.6 	aec 981004
	clustering to terminals is only allowed if they are movable

1.7	aec 981005
	added BestHEM as a clustering algorithm

1.8	aec 981007
	ClusteredHGraph now takes 2 partitionions (optionally).  The
	first is a Constraints, the second partitioning.  It produces
	a solution for the top level, as before, but also a Constraints
	partitioning for each level.

1.10	aec 990222
	added CutOptimal Clustering

2.2	aec 990711
	added new clustering algorith, PinHEM, which is now the default.
	PHEM is a HEM-style clustering algorithm that uses 
	as edge weights 2 for shared degree-2 edges, and 1 else.

2.7.2   sm 010507
        added new clustering algorithm, Random.
        Random is a clustering algorithm that picks neighboring cells
        for clustering at random.

2.8     ilm 020824
        ported to g++ 3.1.1
