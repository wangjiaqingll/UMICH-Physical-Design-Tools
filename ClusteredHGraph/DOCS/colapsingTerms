- ClusteredHGraph does, conditional on a parameter option, colapsing of
	terminals.  The method is as follows:

1) if there are no terminals in the leaflevel HGraph, then this isn't an issue
2) if a fixedConstraints partitioning was not passed, then all terminals
	are treated exactly like movables. (though, they will still be
	terminals in the created HGraphs)
3)
