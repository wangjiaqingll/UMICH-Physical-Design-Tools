 Authors: (design and implementation) Andy Caldwell, Igor Markov

     OS and compilers supported : CC 4.2+ for  Solaris 2.5+,
                               MSVC++5.0 for Windows NT4.0
                                   (probably for Windows '95 as well)
     compilers not supported : MSVC++4.x, g++ 2.7.2, CC 4.1

   ******************  THIS IS THE SOLARIS DISTRIBUTION ***************


 Libraries used : STL 2.03  (see STL note below), ABKCommon3.7
                  HGraph2.42, PartEval1.5, FMPart1.7 Sanchis1.1

 Formal C++ interface : mlPart.h

 Linking interface: one shared (libmlPart.so) or static (libmlPart.a) library
 Test:
         produce executable mlPartTest0` with "make test", then use 
         script "regression"; correct output contains

          Differences from precomputed results
           0       0       0 diffs.notime

         If you do not get zeros, look at the file diffs.notime
         and if you think the differences are essential, 
         email them to <imarkov@math.ucla.edu>

  Purify note :        you may want to put

suppress umr ...; Timer*

                     into your ~/.purify file because purify reports
                     uninitialized memory reads in UNIX system calls.
