	-added getUnscaledCost to basePartEval.
	-changed basePartEval::operatr() to use the above function, then scale.
	-added _bestSolnNum + get/set for it to PartProb.h
1.18  ilm 98401
        - added PartProb::saveBestSol()
        - _bestSolNum is set to UINT_MAX by default 
        _ _solnBuffers are now initialized correctly
1.19  aec 980401
	- changed BasePart::findBestSol() to set bestSolnNum in PartProb
	- added isDataOwned to PartProb
	- added reserveBuffers to PartProb

1.20 ilm 980402

          (changes to partProbIO.cxx and main2.cxx)

1.21.2 ilm 980403
        - _terminalToBlock is now of length numTerminals
        - optional verbosity params added

2.7
        -improvements to partitioning buffers (ranges of used solutions
         and memory caps)
2.8 	aec
	-moved initRandomSolnGenerator from basePartitioner to 
		PartProblem
	-changed base & greedy partitioner to take  & store a non-const
		PartProblem
2.9	aec
	-conversion to PartitioningBuffers
	-PartitionProblem now has a PartitioningBuffer
	-added ctor to PartitionIds that takes an unsigned as an argument.
	  It populates ALL partitions up to (and including) that one.
2.10    aec
	-moved PartitionIds to Combinatorics

3.1     ilm 
        -removed all stuff related basePart and basePartEval
3.2  980520
  ilm  - added getXTics(), getYTics(), getNumXParts(), getNumYParts()
       - reworked regression tests

3.6.1 980713
  ilm  - postProcessor now changes empty constraints to "freeToMove"
       - terminal propagation only applies to constraints, not solution
         buffers

3.7 980719
  ilm  - added vector<double> _const and _violations to partProb
         (multiple changes to support those)

3.8 980811
  ilm  - added relaxPart(Partitioning&,const HGraphFixed&)

3.9 980910
  aec  - removed code which cleared the weights of terminals. As of Now:
	for actual area, terminal areas are taken directly from the .are file
	for unit area, terminals have unit area, just like everything else

4.0 980929 
 ilm  - added PartitioningProblem::Parameters, derived from HGBase::Parameters;

4.1 981203
   sm - added SubPartitioningProblem, derived from PartitioningProblem
        it will take hgraph, placement, and layoutBBox and generate
        a new partitioning problem with hgraph that are in the given
        window

4.3+ 990509
   ilm - updated PartProbIO to correctly process multi-weighted instances
         and avoid creating .fix file when not necessary
4.3.1 990517
   aec - fixed bug in partitionData.cxx::PartitioningSolution ctor, which
	 assumed there to be only one weight

4.4  990719
   ilm - the area of nodes that have an associated "pad block" is zeroed
4.8  020824
   ilm - ported to g++ 3.1.1
