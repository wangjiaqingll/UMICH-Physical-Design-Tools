 UCLA Small Placement Problem Netlist File Format 1.1
  981206	AEC  Created       1.0
  990429        ILM  Modified into 1.1

1) the Small Placement Netlist files are denoted by an "pln" extension

2) pln files contain information about the netlist being placed, including:
	-number of nets
	-number of cells
	-pin offset of each net-cell connection
	-width of each cell 

3) the format for the file is as follows:

UCLA pln 1.1
Cells : <#cells>
Nets  : <#nets>

Net <NetIdx> : <cellIdx> ( <x-pinOffset> <y-pinOffset> )
	     <cellIdx> ( <x-pinOffset> <y-pinOffset> )
	     <cellIdx> ( <x-pinOffset> <y-pinOffset> )
	     <cellIdx> ( <x-pinOffset> <y-pinOffset> )
Net <NetIdx> : <cellIdx> ( <x-pinOffset> <y-pinOffset> )
	     <cellIdx> ( <x-pinOffset> <y-pinOffset> )

etc...

	-pin offsets are measured from the lower-left corner of the cell.

4) cells and nets are numbered consecutively from 0 (there are no pads)

5) only pin offsets for conections between movable cells and nets 
	are specified. Connections from nets to terminal pins are
	given by the net's BBox, which is part of the PlacementProblemContext
	(plc file)

6) There must be an entry for each net - and each net must be attached to
	at least 1 node. 

7) Sample file:  problem1.pln

UCLA pln 1.1
Cells : 3
Nets  : 4

Net 0 :	0 ( 0.5 2.0 )
	2 ( 6.0 3.0 )	
Net 1 : 0 ( 4.2 5.1 )
Net 2 : 1 ( 5.1 2.2 )
Net 3 : 2 ( 5 6 )
	0 ( 2 3 )

-note that nets/cells need not be listed in order.




UCLA Small Placement Problem Area File Format

1) the Small Placement Area files are denoted by an "pla" extension
2) pla files contain the areas for each cell
3) the format for the file is as follows:

UCLA pla 1.1
Cells : <#cells>

Cell <CellIdx> : <cell width>
Cell <CellIdx> : <cell width>
Cell <CellIdx> : <cell width>

4) the number of cells in the pla file must match the number of cells in 
	the pln file.
5) a pla file need not be present. If one is not, each cell is assumed
	to have area equal to one site width (site width is contained in the
	plc file)
6) if a pla file is present, it must include an area for every cell.
7) example file

UCLA pla 1.1
Cells : 3

Cell 0 : 4
Cell 1 : 8
Cell 2 : 4 


UCLA Small Placement Problem Context File Format
  981207	AEC

1) the Small Placement Context files are denoted by an "plc" extension

2) plc files contain information about the rows and terminals on nets:
	-size and site spacing for each row
	-bounding box of the terminals on each net

3) the format for the file is as follows:

UCLA plc 1.1

Rows : <#rows>
Total Nets : <#nets>
Net BBoxes : <#BBoxes>

Row <rowIdx> : <xMin> <yMin> <xMax> <yMax>    <-- bounding box of the row
	     <siteSpacing>		     <-- spacing of sites
Row <rowIdx> : <xMin> <yMin> <xMax> <yMax>
	     <siteSpacing>

Net <netIdx> : <xMin> <yMin> <xMax> <yMax>    <-- bounding box of terminal pins
						on this net
Net <netIdx> : <xMin> <yMin> <xMax> <yMax>

-if a net is not listed, it is assumed to have no terminals

4) Sample file:  problem1.plc

UCLA plc 1.1

Rows : 2
Total Nets : 4
Net BBoxes : 2

Row 0 : 5 10.5 985 28.5   90
Row 1 : 5 40.5 985 58.5   90
Net 2 : -0.78 9.0 400.0 345
Net 3 : 0 0 1000 1000


-note that nets/rows  not have to be listed in order
