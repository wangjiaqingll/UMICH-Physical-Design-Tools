 MetaPlacer 1.1  ILM Dec 1, 1999

  -  created class MetaPlacer that implements most of code 
     from former main0.cxx and main1.cxx; it automagically
     detects different kinds of .aux files and instantiates
     resp. datastructs
  -  currently supported .aux formats are LEFDEF* and RowBasedPlacement
  -  moved main0.cxx into main2.cxx and created a new main0.cxx
  -  the  options are -help, -flip, -save, -doRowIroning
     Currently cell flipping can only be done on LEFDEF input, 
       you get an abkwarn if you request -flip on RowBasedPlacement
  -  Files saved by -save are called out.pl and out.def
