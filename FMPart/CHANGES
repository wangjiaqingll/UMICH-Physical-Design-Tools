2.7  aec 062998	aec
	-changed FM to use only one MoveManager for all starts
3.2  ilm 071198 ilm
        -now 2way evals are turned on automatically in setMoveManager.cxx
         for bipartitioning

3.5  ilm 071998
        -tie breaking on imbalances
3.6  aec 072098
	-update to Partitioners1.7 (partLeg moves to mmTemplBase)
	-moveMgr->reinitialize moved to begining of a pass + 	
		addition of necessary data items for this in fmPart.cxx
	-bool skipSolnGen added to ctor
4.6  aec 090398
        -wrapped D&D code and plugged in instead of generic MM
4.7  ilm 090498 
        -tried an alternative speedup, couldn't beat D&D (4.6 is still current)
4.8  ilm/aec 090498
        -added Clip, fixed nodes and locking large nodes
5.0  ilm 090698
        -added back CLR, _params.useOptimizedMM and -unCorking are processed
5.1  ilm 090698
        -  2-pin net speedup in D&D code
5.2  ilm 090698
        -generic FMMM sped up by testing nets for not
         being affected by a move
5.3  ilm 090698
        - 2-pin net speed-up in the generic FMMM and FMMMwCLR
5.5  ilm 090698
        - added uncorking (-unCork)
5.6,5.7 ilm 090998
        - more speedups
6.0  ilm 150998
        - there are now 5 move managers (D&D, FM generic, FMLIFOwCLR, FMCLIPwCLR,
                                         FM-way with NetCut)
6.1  ilm 170998
        - parametrized gain container by gain bucket type
          (SplitDestCentricGainCo is now available)
6.2  ilm 200998
        - move manager w hybrid buckets now available
6.3  ilm 220998
        - added MoveManagerSwitchBoxInterface and two concrete types
        - fmPart.cxx and setMoveManager.cxx now use switch boxes
        - added MM types FMDD and FMHybrid, removed parameter useOptimizedMM 

6.6.2 aec 990304
	- test version of uncorking - this version removed any illegal node
	  when it was the highest gain move.  This is the only version with
	  this type of uncorking
6.7   aec 990304
	- test version for temporary illegalities.  Only allowed an 
	  illegal move if the move was illegal by <= a multiple of the
	  min (non-zero) cell size.  This is in this version only.

6.8   aec 990307
	- modification to uncorking - large nodes are only removed from the
	  gain-buckets prior to the pass if the initial solution (at the
	  start of the pass) is legal

6.17  aec 991015
	- made D&D movemanager use integer edge-weights.

7.1   ilm 001002
        - a series of changes in move managers and FMPart to
          allow saving the move log (depending on a parameter value).
          See FMPart5.cxx for an example.


7.2   dap 010601
	- improved performance of the fmpart gain container.

7.3   dap 010627
	- improved performance of evaluators
	- changed FMPart to use weights if given

7.4   dap 010707
        - changed FMPart to use weights CORRECTLY :)
	- separated the performance hit of using weights from non-weighted tests        - added the command line parameter -useWts
7.5   dap 010713
        - ok no joke this time, weights work :P 
7.6   dap 010808
        - changed gain container to be implemented with a map
	- added probabalistic bucket selection to gain container
	- made weights propagate throughout the params, such that
	  running without weights, then with weights is easy (see FMPartTest8)
7.7   ilm 020824
        - ported to g++ 3.1.1
