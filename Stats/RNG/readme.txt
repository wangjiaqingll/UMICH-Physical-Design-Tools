Permission is granted to use or distribute but not to sell. 

This updates newran to bring it in line with newmat09, includes some
additional distributions and improves the documentation. Newran02A
updates the exception library and the make files and removes an
incompatibility with MS VC++ 5

This is a C++ library for generating sequences of random numbers from a
wide variety of distributions. It is particularly appropriate for
the situation where one requires sequences of identically distributed
random numbers since the set up time for each type of distribution
is relatively long but it is efficient when generating each new random
number. The library includes classes for generating random
numbers from a number of distributions and is easily extended to be able to
generate random numbers from almost any of the standard
distributions. 

Newran02, fixes some bugs, includes more extensive testing, has been
updated to be compatible with newmat09 and includes some
additional distributions. Newran02A includes an updated version of the
exception library.
