CHANGES to package StatzenPlotz

1.3 971005  mro  -- corrected standard deviation as returned
                    from TrivialStatsWithStdDev (it was actually
                    returning variance).

                 -- corrected bug caused by unsigned overflow
                    in rancor.cxx (see variable en3n in compute_rankcorr().
                    If "size" is used instead of "dsize", right-hand side
                    can overflow.)

1.4 971006  ilm  -- inlined all methods defined in freqDistr.h
                 -- now one-point intervals are printed as [2,2]
                    rather than [2,2)
                 -- added the word "decile" to output of FreqDistr
                 -- moved main5.cxx to main4.cxx (incl. Makefile
                    and regression script)
                 -- updated regression script

1.5  970108 mro  -- restored part of correction for ties in RankCorrelation
                    and took scope resolution operator out of definition
                    of compute_rankcorr() (ask Chuck if it gives him trouble)

1.5.1 980126 ilm -- added an optional argument to the FreqDistribution
                    ctors setting the number of subranges for ASCII output.
                    This goes in between the vector argument and the 
		    enum type parameter, so the old calls setting the
		    parameter explicitely (to Magnitudes) will not work
		    correctly, giving only one range for a wrong type.

1.6   980410 ilm -- added class BiasedRandomSelection (aka LoadedDie)

1.8   980826 ilm -- added class KeyCounter, regression tests 5 and 6

1.9   981206 ilm -- added class ExpectedMins, regression test 8
2.3   020824 ilm -- ported to g++ 3.1.1
