******************  THIS IS THE SOLARIS DISTRIBUTION ***************


Libraries used:
   STL
   ABKCommon

Formal C++ interface:
   combi.h             (see main0.cxx through main3.cxx for sample uses)
   grayTransp.h        (see main4.cxx)

Linking interface:
   libcombi.a
   libcombi.so

Test:
      requires files regression, test.netD, test.are
      produce executable "make test", then use
      script "regression"; correct output contains

  lines:  words:  bytes: in error log:
       0       0       0 test0.diff

	and similarly for other tests

      If you do not get zeros, look at the error log file and
      if you think the differences are essential, email them
      to <mmoroz@ucla.edu>

Installation notes: customize Makefile to your filesystem,
                     Type make. This will build the libraries.
                     The shared library can not be
                     moved from its initial location.
