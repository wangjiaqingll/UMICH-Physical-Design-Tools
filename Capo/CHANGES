        ilm     fmPartCont and mlPartCont can now be implemented
                in PartCont  to avoid duplication of code and
                interfaces
        ilm     simplified and un-templated PartCont
                by moving evaluator switch logic into basePartCont
                and moving code from PartCont into basePartCont
        ilm     slight changes to Capo::Parameters processing

3.3.1 980302

         ilm    bug fixes in Capo::Parameters and basePartCont::_terminalBlocks

3.5   980304
         ilm    several simplifications in basePartController,
                added getNets() to CapoBlock, etc

		(row major)

3.7   980313
        ilm     revised CapoPlacer::Parameters
        ilm     added cmd line parameter processing to CapoPlacer::Parameters
        ilm     now the original argc, argv are saved in the class  
        ilm     three partitioners (Greedy2Way, FM2Way and FMClip2Way) are
                supported as well as all existing evaluators -- dozen+
        ilm     reworked main0.cxx (read comments in it!)
        
3.8  980313
        ilm     added support for Verbosity to CapoPlacer and BasePartCont
        ilm     simplified main0.cxx a bit
        ilm     changed parentMap to hash_map in capoBlock.smashTillN()
                and ML controller
3.8.1  980313
        ilm     ML controller now works
        ilm     ML is now default, use -flat if needed 
        ilm     FM is now default, use -part Greedy2Way if needed
        ilm     hpl with all combinations of Greedy/FM flat/ML is purify-clean
        ilm     added USparseMat declaration to BasePartCont::_callPartitioner()

                wrt PartProblem

3.10.8 980327
        ilm     split ClSubTreeH.h fromClSubTreeH.h  --- will move
                to Clustering
3.13   980401
        ilm     added procesing of -savePartProb parameter which tells
	        MLPart on which levels it should save PartitioningProblems

3.18   980412
	aec	added PartProblemFromBlocks
		added measurment of WL at a level with Evaluator objects
		added multiple runs to main0
	
3.14   980401
        ilm     added CapoBlock::splitBlock() called from refineBlock()
        ilm     split capoPlacer.cxx into refineBlock.cxx and the remainder

3.19   980412
	aec	added tree-reclustering
3.20   980428
	aec	added vertical cut tolerance as a parameter & code to use
			it in splitBlock.cxx
	aec     added capoPlacer:_nodesInEachBlock and _terminalsToEachBlock.
			They will be used for computing rent parameters
	aec	changed splitBlock to use the FMClip 2-way partitioner
			if it is a 2-way cut, Sanchis otherwise
		
3.21	980504
	 aec	added thresholding nets to 30 (now an ML Param)
	 aec	added param for removing inessential nets (default is yes)	
	 aec    changed cut-dir algorithm.  It now cuts horiz. any block
		with >= 30 cells and > 1 row.
	 aec    fix & extended single row placer

6.0	981128
	 aec	re-working of Capo.  CapoBlocks changed significantly, and
		small placers were moved into their own package. See
		the DOCS directory for details on the 'new' capoBlocks.
6.0.2   981203
	aec	re-worked split block functions. Added PartProbForCapo,
		and SubHGraphForCapo.  Problems produced by Capo now
		only have (at most) 2 terminals, in the bi-partitioning
		case.
6.1	981206
	aec	made bit_vector edgeVisited in PartProbForCapo::buildHGraph
		static.  added tracking for #edges/ave edge degree, with
		and without inessential edges.
6.2     981209
	aec	added SmallPlaceProbForCapo

6.3	981217
	aec	added params + hooks for seeding partitioners with 
		analit. placers (for TCAD15)
	aec	fixed bug in CapoBlocks -> DBL_MIN changed to -DBL_MAX

6.3.1   990103
	aec	small re-org for SplitBlock.  Moved seeding w/ a partitioner
	 	to a seperate function.
	aec     replaced 'TermiProp' object in partProbForCapo w/
		direct comparison to locations.  Speed up smallPlProb
		construction slightly.
6.4	990210
	aec	major Capo revision.  Capo now operates only on RBPlacement.
		CapoBlocks use actual contained site areas to compute
		 capacity.
		Horizontal partitioning tolerance is computed with a 
		 formula described in ~projects/CAPO/AreaMgt

6.5	990215
	AEC	skyline method of computing vertical cuts.
        AEC	fixed mem allocation problem in SmallPlProb ctor

6.6 	990223
	AEC	added getWhitespace, getRelativeWhitespace functions to
		 CapoBlocks.
		added horiz-cut parameter + alternative methods for
	 	 computing hCut tolerance
	 	removed restriction on overfilled blocks - they are
		 now allowed with a warning
6.7	990304
	aec	added ctor to PartProbForCapo to build a problem from
	  	 2 blocks.

6.8     990319  now all CapoBlocks maintain a reflexive 4-directed 
        ilm     neighborhood relation
                Capo levels now either split blocks or copy to the next level
                to make neighborhood relation reflexive. Therefore, the 
                stopping criterion in the main Capo loop has been changed to
                from "is level empty" to "are there unplaced blocks".
                refineBlock() now returns "this block's has children that
                need to be partitioned/placed".

6.9   	990320  split file splitBlock.cxx into splitBlock.cxx and
		partitionBlock.cxx.  PartitionBlock contains the
		functions which setup and call the partitioner.  
		Split block contains functions to construct the new blocks,
		given the partitioning.

		Added ySplit finding.

6.10	990326	xSplit finding.  The new method eliminates small blocks
	 	containing sub-rows buy splitting at them early in
		the hierarchy.

6.12    990408  added a new option -plotBlocks (off by default) which causes
        ilm     capoBlocks-layerX.gp to be saved (X=0,1,2...). 
                Note: this adds to run time.

6.13    990426
	aec	capo now uses actual pin locations (for pins on placed
		cells) when doing terminal prop.  A vector<orientation>
		was added to CapoPlacer.

6.14	990428
	aec	-actual pin locations commented out (made things worse)
		-uses BBFM 'shell partitioner' for small problems of
		 size <= 40.  Maximum of 4M pushes (~10sec) with
		 6 FM starts (5 random) is used for the shell partitioner
		-removed SmallPlacementProbForCapo, replaced with call
		 to new SmallPlProb ctor.

6.15	990510
	aec	-added parameter 
		 'replaceSmallBlocks <never|AtTheEnd|AtEachLayer>'. 
		 default value is never (meaning never replace..each
		 block is placed exactly once).
		-moved capo's main loop into a seperate function in 	
		 a new file, capoMainLoop.cxx
6.16    990704
	aec	-small change: reduced verbosity passed to smallplacer

6.17    991015
	aec	-improved block splitting decisions in situations w/
		 un-even length rows

6.18    991015
	aec	-added output of WWL 

7.1     991020
	aec	-removed all block splitting/creation functions from
		 Capo. Created new 'splitter classes.
7.1.1   991021
	aec	-removed code rendered useless by 7.1 change

7.4     991201  -added ctor that takes a floorplanning solution and an
		 hcl file and begins from the floorplanning.

7.8     000215
	aec	-moved Capo Parameters into seperate .h file. They
		are no longer defined inside Capo.  Moved CapoSplitterParams
		into the same .h file, and its body into capoParams.cxx.
		-general parameter cleanup. Removal of many old/redundant
		parameters.
		-cleanup of tolerance options and the processing of them.
		-addition of useNameHierarchy parameter
		-changed saving block membership file to be triggered
		by the 'saveBlocks' option, rather than verbosity > 2.
