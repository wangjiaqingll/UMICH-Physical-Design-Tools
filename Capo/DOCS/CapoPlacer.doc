  Primary Data Structures:


   Placement
	stores locations of each node. This placement is
   	constantly updated : for fixed nodes, or nodes which have been
   	placed (via a small placer, for example) the actual location of 
   	the node is immediately stored here.  Nodes which have not yet
   	been placed are considered to be at the center of the block 
   	containing them, and are marked in the Placement as such.

   bit_vector _fixed;

	a node is marked as being 'fixed' in this bit_vector when:
	-it is initially fixed in the DB given to Capo
	-it is finally placed (by a small placer, for example)
