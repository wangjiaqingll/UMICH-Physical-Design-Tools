AEC  981130


1) upgrade subHGraph to use HGraphs's faster ctor methods
2) examin PartProb...can it be simplified?
3) for problems below some size threshold, partition max capacity should
	be actual capacity of the intented sub-blocks, not totalCellArea +
	balance tol.
4) loosen balance tol on horiz cuts, and implement re-sizing of horiz
	boundries between blocks to compensate.
5) remove use of 'TermiProp' in PartProbForCapo..there are much simpler faster
	ways
6) remove large local bit-vectors from SmallPlProbForCapo
7) set cell orientations based on what row they are in...
