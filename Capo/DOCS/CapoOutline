Overview Of the Capo Placer:


Capo is a top-down partitioning based global placment tool.

The intent is for Capo itself to manage layout areas, and construct
	individual problems to be solved (partitionings, placements, etc.),
	which it then has other tools/packages solve.

The primary components of Capo are:

class CapoPlacer : public Placement

  The Capo placer itself.  
  Input:
	DB&		db
	Parameters	params
  Output:
	Capo is a Placement (it populates itself upon construction)
	Optionally outputs statistics (run-time, WL, etc.)

  

class CapoBlock
  
  A block of the layout area (a sequence of contiguous (horizontal) rows, 
				and an x-interval)
  Primarially a data storage class 

  Input:
	Interval& 		interval // the x-interval of the block
	vector<unsigned>&	cellIds  // the index of all cells
					 // (movable or fixed) contained
					 // within the region
	FixedHGraph&		hgraph
	vec<dbRow&>::iterator	rowsBegin//the first row
	vec<dbRow&>::iterator	rowsEnd  //the last row

  Output:
	none: CapoBlock is a storage class, not a computation class




Block Partitioning Issues

  Assuming a 2-way partitioning, Capo splits the block along its longer
side.  For horizontal cuts, the default balance tolerance is 2%.  For
vertical cuts it is 10%.  Capo will adjust the vertical cut-line to
match the actual balance of the resulting partitioning.  __It will not
move a horizontal cut line__.  This allows for the posibility of
sliding the vertical cuts later, to balance out area usage.
