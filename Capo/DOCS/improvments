-changed tolerance computation from the one in the w.s. paper.  For
 non-overfilled blocks, we were setting the tolerance to 
 max(computed tol, median cell size).  However, B&B partitioners do not 
 need such allowances.  So, for problems below the smallPart threshold,
 the tolerance is not relaxed in such situations.
