class SubHGraphForCapo


SubHGraphForCapo is derived from SubHGraph, which is derived from HGraphFixed.

It is constructed from:

   const CapoBlock& 	block 
   const vector<BBox>&  partitioning //the proposed partitioning of the block..
					//this is necessary for terminal prop.

 SubHGraphForCapo also contains the following additional information

   vector<unsigned> terminalblocks
   vector<BBox>     padBlocks

   which are accessable throught the public functions

   const vector<unsigned>& getTerminalBlocks() const;
   const vector<BBox>& getPadBlocks() const;
