Basic Installation
==================

The simplest way to compile this package is:


  1. `cd' to the 'lef' sub-directory containing the package's 
     source code. 

  2. Type `gmake' to compile and build the package.
     `gmake release' will set DEBUG with the OPTIMIZE_FLAG.

  3. Optionally, type `./gmake test' to run tests that come with
     the package.

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `gmake clean'.
