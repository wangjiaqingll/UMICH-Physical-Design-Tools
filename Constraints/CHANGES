1.6  970730  ilm    added  SoftGroupConstraint and MultRectRegionConstraint
                    rearranged *.h and *.cxx files
                    some loops now go backwards for speed
		    changed ordering of ctraints

                    added  in bool BBox(BBox& bbx)  const to most classes
1.8.1 970730-97081
             ilm    reworked Constraints::compactify() 
             ilm    added special acces to FixedType constraints
	     ilm    added Constraints::getPermutation() which puts constrained
                    cells first
1.9.5 970815 ilm    added Constraints::allConstrSatisfied()
             ilm    added support for O(1) test for fixed/fixedX/fixedY
2.0   970815 ilm    added pullBack ctor for class Constraints and 
                          corresp. methods in individual constraints
             ilm    split realConstr.h into fxTypeConstr.h, regionConstr.h,
                          otherConstr.h and *cxx files; users may now need
                          to include allConstr.h in addition to constraints.h
                          (regionConstr.h and otherConstr.h are not included
                          by constraints.h)
2.1   970823 ilm    changed all vector<bool> from bit_vector
2.2   970825 ilm    added Placement re-association ctor to class Constraints
             ilm    changed Constraints copy-like ctors to compactify if the
                          argument was compactified
             ilm    added Constraint.isFixedType()
             ilm    added cloning with placement re-association to all
                          individual Constraint classes
2.3   970828 ilm    separated restriction from pull-back
      970828 ilm    reimplemented restriction and added pull-back,
                     both with partial inverse
                     (restriction used sorting and binary_search)
2.4   970907 ilm    added FIXEDONLY filter
2.5   970923 ilm    added simplified ctors for FixedTypeConstraints
2.6   971126 ilm    added Constraints::getFixedBBox() and corresp.
                          methods in each FixedTypeConstraint
      971121 ilm added "add-constraint with re-association"

2.6.1 971216 mro virtual destructors in regionConstr.h are now
                 defined in .cxx file; same for ~Constraint()
2.8   000503 ilm ported to Sun CC5.0
2.9   020824 ilm ported to g++ 3.1.1
