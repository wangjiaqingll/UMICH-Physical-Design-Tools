 Libraries used : STL 2.01 (see STL note below) ABKCommon2.1 Placement3.8.1

 Formal C++ interface : constraints.h, plus allConstr.h (if needed)

 note: the two headers not included by constraints.h, but included by
       allConstr.h are regionConstr.h and otherConstr.h (dbConstr.h 
       included regionConstr.h only)

 Linking interface: 
   one static (libconstr.a) or shared (libconstr.so) library

 Test (no tests yet):
         produce executable rnplacerTest with "make test", then use 
         script "regression"; correct output contains

 Installation notes : customize Makefile to your filesystem,
		      Type make. This will build the libraries. 
                      The shared library can not be
		      moved from its initial location.

  Purify note :        you may want to put

suppress umr ...; Timer*

                     into your ~/.purify file because purify reports
                     uninitialized memory reads in UNIX system calls.

  STL note: you need an *adapted* version 2.01  970718) or higher.
