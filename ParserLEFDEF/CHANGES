971115 mro Corrected problem in lefparse.y; master pin ports specified
           as vias are now considered in the bounding box of the pin.

971204 mro Added CompareLayerGeoms to sort layer geometries in a via;
           used it to be able to compare vias from LEF and DEF to see
           if they're the same.  Changes to parserLEFDEF.h, lefparse.y,
           defparse.y

971209 mro Add master-cell origins into master-pin port geometries.
           Same for obstructions.
           change to lefparse.y

980126 mro Fix problem with REGIONS section in DEF.  Change to defparse.y
