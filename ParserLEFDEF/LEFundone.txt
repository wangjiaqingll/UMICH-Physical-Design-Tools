This is a list of rules in lefparse.y where something might be done, but isn't
The ones that start with * are rules where it IS handled, so they're not
properly part of the list as described above.

The ones that start with - are ones where I don't believe there's any
place in the DB to put this info.

A line starting with & means that the particular rule named is done,
except possibly for something depending on rules it depends on, which
will be listed indented.

A line starting with ! is something that needs to be added.

A line starting with ? means it's not clear what needs to be done.

*case_stmt       (case sensitive or not)
*units_stmt      (distance units only ones that matter)
-dielectric_stmt (LEF 1-37, diel. const. of insulator)

            &COVER,RING,BLOCK,CORE,PAD,ENDCAP  -done, except:

                                      I don't think this is in DB).

        ?timing_stmt (values in DB do not correspond 1-1)

    ? a whole bunch of timing info that doesn't correspond 1-1 with DB:

&obs_stmt (MACRO obstruction; done except noted facts on geometries below)

&layer_geom
    *layer
    &gen_geom
        &geom (geometry specified other than as a via)
            *rect (ordinary rectangular geometry)
            ? all the other ways of specifying them
                   (i.e. path, polygon, iterated rectangle, iterated path,
                    iterated polygon.  These will give warnings if they
                    show up in any of our files)

        ?via_geom (this is when you give the geometry by naming a via.
                   I still don't know exactly what this means.  Right
                   now it will give a warning.  Unfortunately we
                   do have some cases of this.  We're not processing
                   vias at all, so this would be some work to fix)



?lef_step_pattern (seems to relate only to GE designs and via_geoms
                   could be relevant if we're doing the latter)

-spacing_stmt (same net spacing.  I don't think we have this in DB (?))

*layer_stmt

?via_stmt (we don't do anything with vias.  Could be necessary if
           we need to use them for geometries)

-viarule_stmt (LEF 1-30. I don't think the DB has any info for this)
-nondefault_stmt  (LEF 1-25.  Nondefault regular wiring rules. Nothing in DB)
-crosstalk_stmt  (LEF 1-32.  Nothing in DB)
*lef_site_stmt (LEF 1-39.  Declares a site)
-lef_array_stmt (LEF 1-40.  Only for GE designs)
-orient   (everything that depends on it is either FOREIGN or GE (I think(?))
