  CHANGES in the Placement package

 4.5   970923 
          pat - added IntervalSeq::getLength()
              - changed name of formal parameter to IntervalSeq::IntervalSeq
              - added some lines to main9.cxx to test getLength
              - updated expected.out for the new getLength test
 
          ilm - added ctor for class Permutation to produce a sorting
                permutation for vector<double> permutation for vector<double>
                (i.e. where the k-th entry will sort to)
              - added main10.cxx to the suite of regression tests
                (updated expected.out)
  4.5.1 970923 
          ilm - Permutation::getInverse() does not require anything 
                about its argument anymore

  4.6   970929 
          ilm - added plStats.h with classes PlCorrelation and PlRankCorrelation
              - added class ClumpInCenter : public Transform to transf.h
              - main11.cxx to demonstrate the above two
                (note: main11.cxx can not be compiled *within*
                the Placement package due to an exceptional circumstance ---
                plStats.h depends on the StatzenPlotz package and Placement
                does not).

  4.7   970929
          ilm - added rwalk.h and rwalk.o with class RandomWalk (aka RWalk)
                class RandomWalk represents a fixed-length random walk starting
                at 0.0, ending at a predefined location (default 0.0) with 
                limited steps. It can be created deterministically or randomly
                (but with a possibility of a "replay")
              - added main12.cxx and modified the regression script accordingly
              - added perturb.h and perturb.cxx with class Perturbation
                (this class allows for two ways to perturb placements 
                and control the perturbations with several parameters)
              - added main13.cxx to demo class Perturbation

  4.7.3 971023
	  pat - added canonicalize and merge to IntervalSeq.
                The first ensures that all intervals are sorted by
	        low coordinate and non-overlapping.  The second
	        merges two IntervalSeqs and ensures that the result
	        is in canonical form.
              - added main14.cxx to test these changes, and updated
		expected.out and the regression script.

  4.7.3 971124
          ilm - cleaned out mess with ABKDEBUG and Mapping::op[]

  4.8.2 971128
          ilm - moved rwalk.{h,cxx} and perturb.{h,cxx} to the BTW subdir

  4.9   971128
          ilm - added xyDraw.{h,cxx} with xyDrawLine(), xyDrawLines() and
                xyDrawRectangle() to be used with gnuplot
          ilm - added main15.cxx (corresp. changes to Makefile and regression)

 4.9.5  971130
          ilm - to draw a line with one dot, xyDrawLine uses the beginning
                   numDots is now optional with default value 1
 4.9.6  971206
          ilm - added BBox::ShrinkTo(double percent=0.9)
                  with percent>0; percent > 1.0 will expand the BBox
          ilm - all BBox modifying methods now return BBox& (for chaining)
          ilm - Placement::_Grid2 now yields a regular grid size*size
                  filling the given BBox 
 5.0   971206
          ilm - added xyDrawPoints()
 
 5.0.5 971212
          ilm - added Subset::_Random

 5.0.6 971216
          mro - xyDrawPoints() moved to .cxx file
       980217 ilm added Interval::getMiddle()

 5.1   980408
          ilm - added double BBox::mdistTo(Point);
 5.2.2 980428
          ilm - added a couple of missing const's in mapping.h
          ilm - renamed Mapping::_Identity into Mapping::Identity
		  ilm - fixed a bug in BBox::shrinkTo()

 5.5  980922
          ilm - added Placement::flipXY()
          ilm - added GridInPlacement

 5.6  980925
          sm  - added layoutBBoxes
      981202
          sm  - added contains and locate in layoutBBoxes
                for checking if a point is inside any box and to find
                the box index

 5.8.1 990219
          sm  - remove MST8 from the package and add GeomTrees package

 6.1	990911
	  aec - added class PlacementWOrient - contains orientations 
		added unsigned size() const to Placement (same functionality
			as getSize..just more standard)
 6.4    020824
          ilm - ported to g++ 3.1.1
