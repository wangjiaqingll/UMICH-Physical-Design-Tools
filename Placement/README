 OS and compilers supported : CC 4.2+ for  Solaris 2.5+,
                               MSVC++5.0 for Windows NT4.0
                                   (probably for Windows '95 as well)
 compilers not supported : MSVC++4.x, g++ 2.7.2, CC 4.1

 Libraries used : STL 2.01 (see STL note below), ABKCommon2.9
 
 Formal interface : placement.h (includes plGeom.h)
                    mapping.h
                    subPlacement.h (includes mapping.h),
                    transf.h,
                    plStats.h (requires the StatzenPlotz package),
                    compar.h
                    rwalk.h

 Linking interface: one static (libplace.a) or shared (libplace.so) library

 Installation notes : customize Makefile to your filesystem,
                      Type make. This will build the libraries.
                      The shared library can not be
                      moved from its initial location.

 Tests : produce executable placeTest with "make test", then use 
         script "regression" in the REGRESSION SUBDIRECTORY
         correct output contains

 Purify note :        you may want to put

suppress umr ...; Timer*

                     into your ~/.purify file because purify reports
                     uninitialized memory reads in UNIX system calls.

  STL note: you need an *adapted* version 2.01  970718) or higher. 
            It is available (together with a testsuite) from
            http://www.ipmce.su/people/fbp/stl/stlport.html. 
            Extensive online documentation is available at

 Remarks:   Placement is a 'generic pointset' class that knows nothing about
            placement algorithms. A standard model for Placer is
            derived class (e.g. QPlacement) which does all the work
            in its constructor.

 Remarks:    Convex hull for 100,000 points takes 5 sec to compute.
             Computing and destroying 100,000 convex hulls for the
             same 20 points takes 31 sec. MST is pretty fast too, but
             it rounds all input coordinates to integers.
